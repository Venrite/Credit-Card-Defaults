The HTML is to see the outputs of the entire project, results and epoch spam included. The ipynb file is to allow others to use it, improve it, or just reproduce my results.
Instructions on how to set up the environment for the ipynb are included within the file; But tensorflow is a requirement with CUDA and cuDNN. guides are provided along with the pip installs required.
Thank you -Zachary Gonzalez
